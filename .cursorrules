Hey, take a look at this Flutter AI project.

🧠 Step 1: Analyze the entire project structure including all folders and files.
- Scan recursively through all directories.
- Understand the purpose of each file (e.g., `main.dart`, `pubspec.yaml`, `lib/`, `assets/`, `models/`, `controllers/`, etc.).

🧾 Step 2: Create a new file named `projectdetails.md` in the root directory.

🛠️ In that markdown file, write the following:

1. **Project Structure Tree View**  
   - Use a clear indented bullet or tree view format.
   - Example:
     ```
     📁 lib/
       ├── main.dart
       ├── ui/
       ├── models/
       └── controllers/
     📁 assets/
     📄 pubspec.yaml
     ```

2. **File Role Descriptions**  
   - Below the tree view, add a section:  
     ### 🔍 File Descriptions
   - For every important file, write 1–2 lines about its purpose.  
     Example:  
     - `main.dart`: Entry point of the app, sets up routing and app theming.  
     - `models/user_model.dart`: Defines the structure of the user data.  
     - `controllers/api_service.dart`: Handles API calls to the AI backend.

3. **Contributing Guide (Optional)**  
   Add a final section:
   ### 🤝 How to Contribute  
   - Point devs to key files they might modify  
   - Briefly mention coding standards if any (e.g., naming, file placement)

📌 Goal: Make it easy for new contributors to quickly understand the codebase and jump into development.
